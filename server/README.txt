I want to simply use html canvas to display my drawings
so somehow I have to pipe my drawings to the canvas

reload on save 
and then call it a day. 

I want to output the results of py5 to the server

I have to figure out how to get the image that is output by py5 
and then redirect it to the server instead, then I can simply pass that information
to the canvas

essentially this is canvas sketch but for python?
